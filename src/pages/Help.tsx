      question: "How much does Droplink cost?",
      answer: "Droplink offers three subscription tiers: Starter (6Ï€ per month), Pro (10Ï€ per month), and Premium (15Ï€ per month). Each tier includes different features and capabilities. All plans are billed annually, and we offer a 7-day free trial of Pro features for new users."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use Droplink without a Pi Network account?",
      answer: "While you can create a basic Droplink account without Pi Network integration, many of our core features like payments and Pi authentication require a Pi Network account. We recommend connecting your Pi Network account to get the full Droplink experience."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I change my username?",
      answer: "You can change your username in Account Settings. Note that if you change your username, your profile URL will also change, which could affect existing links you've shared."

    {
      question: "Can I schedule links to appear at specific times?",
      answer: "Yes, Pro and Premium users can schedule links to appear and disappear at specific dates and times. This is useful for limited-time promotions or time-sensitive content."
