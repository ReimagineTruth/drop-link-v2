# Pi Payment Integration Guide for Droplink

---

## 1. Overview

This document explains how to integrate Pi Network payments into Droplink for features like:

* Subscription payments (Starter, Pro, Premium plans)
* One-time payments (e.g., group creation fees)
* Pi Tips (crypto tipping buttons on user profiles and links)

---

## 2. Prerequisites

* Pi Network Developer account with access to Pi SDK
* Pi App Credentials (App ID, API keys)
* Backend server able to handle Pi SDK calls securely
* User authentication system integrated with Pi Wallet linking

---

## 3. Integration Flow

### 3.1 User Wallet Linking

* On user signup/login, prompt user to link their Pi Wallet to Droplink account
* Use Pi SDKâ€™s authentication method to verify wallet ownership
* Store linked wallet address/token securely in user profile database

### 3.2 Payment Processing

* When a user initiates a payment (subscription upgrade, group fee, etc.):

  * Generate a payment request via Pi SDK backend API
  * Show payment confirmation UI on frontend with Pi Wallet pay button
  * User approves payment in Pi Wallet app
  * Backend verifies payment confirmation via Pi SDK webhook or polling
  * Update user subscription status or unlock paid feature upon confirmation

### 3.3 Pi Tips Button

* On user public profiles and individual link pages:

  * Display a Pi Tips button with a QR code or direct payment link
  * Allow visitors to tip any amount via their Pi Wallet
  * Optionally track tip amounts for user analytics
  * Process tips as instant payments (no subscription required)

---

## 4. Backend Setup

* Install Pi SDK libraries (Node.js / Python / etc.) on server
* Create secure endpoints for:

  * Payment initiation
  * Payment confirmation webhook
  * Wallet linking verification
* Store transaction records for audit and user history
* Handle retries and payment failures gracefully

---

## 5. Frontend Implementation

* Integrate Pi SDK JavaScript library for payment UI
* Use wallet link flow during authentication
* Show payment status indicators (pending, success, failure)
* Securely send payment requests to backend APIs
* Display Pi Tips button and QR code generator component

---

## 6. Security Considerations

* Never expose secret API keys on frontend
* Use HTTPS for all API calls
* Validate all payment confirmations server-side
* Implement rate limiting and anti-fraud checks
* Keep user wallet info encrypted and private

---

## 7. Testing & Debugging

* Use Pi test environment or sandbox if available
* Simulate payment flows with test wallets
* Monitor logs for payment webhook failures
* Validate all edge cases (network errors, user cancellation)

---

## 9. Example Code Snippet (Node.js)

```javascript
const PiSDK = require('pi-sdk');
const pi = new PiSDK({ appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID', appSecret: 'YOUR_SECRET' });

// Create payment request
async function createPayment(userId, amountPi) {
  const payment = await pi.createPayment({
    userId,
    amount: amountPi,
    currency: 'PI',
    description: 'Droplink Subscription Upgrade'
  });
  return payment;
}

// Verify payment webhook
app.post('/api/pi-payment-webhook', async (req, res) => {
  const paymentData = req.body;
  const verified = await pi.verifyPayment(paymentData);
  if (verified) {
    // Update user subscription status in DB
    res.status(200).send('Payment verified');
  } else {
    res.status(400).send('Verification failed');
  }
});
```
